"""Hourly time-of-extremum template for Open Meteo - MEDIUM DIFFICULTY.

Asks at what time today a city will reach its peak or lowest hourly value
for a given metric. The agent starts on the generic docs page, finds the
city, then scans the hourly forecast to find the argmax/argmin time.

Dynamic data: hourly forecasts update continuously.
Time-sensitive: asks about "today" which changes daily.
Computation required: agent must find the extremum AND report its time.

SFT defense:
- Temperature is EXCLUDED because its diurnal cycle is a textbook fixed
  pattern (peak ~14:00, min ~05:00) that SFT can memorise.
- Remaining metrics (humidity, wind speed, precipitation probability) have
  weather-dependent patterns that vary significantly by day and location.
- Humidity has a weak inverse-temperature pattern (~40% reliable) but the
  exact hour varies enough that ±1h accuracy is hard without reading data.

Effective variants: 170 cities x 3 metrics x 2 (max/min) = 1,020 (>500).
